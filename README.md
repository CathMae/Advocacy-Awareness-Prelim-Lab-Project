# A Guide to branches 
// To change branch, click the branch button and from there click the branch where you'd like to upload your file.

1. The MASTER branch : we can only upload files here for final products, such as final html document and final css file. At the moment, anyone can upload an empty html and css file.
2. PAGE-IDEAS branch: the files that we can upload here are suggestions as to how we'd like to see the page. It can be a suggestion for the design or the content.
